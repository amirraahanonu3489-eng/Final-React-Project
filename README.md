# Final-React-Project, Income & Expense Tracker 

A React-based income and expense tracker that allows users to manage personal financies by adding, editing, and deleting transactions. The application calulates total balance, income and expenses while using React Context and Reducers for clean code. 

 This app was a rebuild from my JavaScript final project!
